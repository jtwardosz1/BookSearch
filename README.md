Instructions:

To use this SPA, please navigate to http://localhost:3000/index.html when the server is running. 

This should display a list of books. Each book will display the Author as a button.

The newly added functionality for Assignment5 includes a search function.

Use this search to find a book title, ISBN number, or author.

When clicking the button with the displayed author's name, it will navigate to show all books written by the author.

You can navigate back to the list of books by clicking the button that says "Back to All Books" next to each book.

Although the search isn't implemented the exact way we did it in class, I wanted to make this search dynamic for my Assignment 4 SPA. 

The main things I learned from this implementation is binding from the input to my searchTerm using vmodel from Vue and using "Computed Properties" in Vue for reactive and recalculated data. This helped make the search function dynamically update the book list as the searchTerm is input.
