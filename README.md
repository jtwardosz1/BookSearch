# README

This was my first introduction to Ruby on Rails. 

This is a simple Web App built over my semester in a Web Development course at MSU Denver.

Instructions:

To use this SPA, please navigate to http://localhost:3000/index.html when the server is running. 

This should display a list of books. Each book will display the Author as a button.

This also includes a search function.

Use this search to find a book title, ISBN number, or author.

When clicking the button with the displayed author's name, it will navigate to show all books written by the author.

You can navigate back to the list of books by clicking the button that says "Back to All Books" next to each book.
